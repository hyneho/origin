What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It sets up the repository objects and meta-data.  These objects must be
	 created first before committing.

	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
	repository? What value do you think it offers?

	It shows which files are going to be added but not yet committed.  It value 
	derives from the fact that changes/additions can be shown before committing 
	and changes can be made.
